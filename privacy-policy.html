        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Local Data Storage (All Users)</h3>
        <p>All your family information, tasks, calendars, and health data is stored exclusively on your device using local database storage. This data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never leaves your device unless you explicitly enable cloud backup</li>
            <li>Is never transmitted to third parties</li>
            <li>Is never used for advertising or marketing</li>

            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, court order, or governmental regulation</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Permission Usage</h3>

            <li><strong>Contacts Access (Optional):</strong> To help add family members from your contacts. This is an optional convenience feature and not required for app functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Permission Control</h3>
        <p>You can revoke any permission at any time through your device's Settings app. The App will continue to function without optional permissions (like contacts), but features requiring specific permissions may be unavailable.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>For Free Users, all data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database technology. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data never leaves your device</li>
            <li>Data is encrypted at rest by your device's operating system</li>
            <li>Data is deleted when you uninstall the app</li>
            <li>You have complete control and ownership of your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Cloud Backup (Pro Users Only)</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a Pro subscription, you may optionally enable encrypted cloud backup. This feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is completely optional and can be disabled at any time</li>
            <li>Uses end-to-end encryption to protect your data in transit and at rest</li>
            <li>Allows data synchronization across your devices</li>
            <li>Can be permanently deleted by you at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Security Measures</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Local data encryption (managed by your device)</li>
            <li>Secure cloud storage with encryption (for Pro users who enable it)</li>
            <li>No unnecessary data collection</li>
            <li>Regular security updates to the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.4 Data Retention</h3>
        <p>Your data is retained as long as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have the App installed on your device</li>
            <li>You choose to retain the data (it's yours after all)</li>
            <li>Or until you explicitly delete it through the App settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        
        <p>Our App is designed to help families manage information about their children. We take children's privacy seriously:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Direct Data Collection from Children:</strong> We do not collect any information directly from children under 13</li>
            <li><strong>Parent/Guardian Control:</strong> Only parents or guardians with access to the device can enter children's information</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> For free users, all children's information remains on the parent's device and is never transmitted or collected by us</li>
            <li><strong>Optional Cloud Backup:</strong> If Pro cloud backup is enabled by the parent, children's data is encrypted and only accessible by the account holder</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Parents can delete children's information at any time</li>
            <li><strong>No Targeted Advertising:</strong> We do not use any data for advertising, especially not children's data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are a parent and believe your child's information has been entered into our App, you can contact us to have it reviewed or deleted (though since we don't collect it, it only exists on your device and you can delete it directly from the App).</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>7.1 App Store Services</h3>
        <p>Our App is distributed through official app stores (Apple App Store). When you download our App, you agree to the app store's terms and conditions. We do not receive any personal information through app store transactions.</p>

        <h3>7.2 In-App Purchases</h3>
        <p>Our App offers optional in-app purchases for themes and Pro features. These transactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are processed entirely by Apple/Google via their secure payment systems</li>
            <li>We do not process or store any payment information</li>
            <li>We only receive transaction confirmations (not card or payment details)</li>
        </ul>
